# About the game
This game loosely follows React's own tutorial found at https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html with a few of my own tweaks including game resetting, drawing matches and styling.

# To run the game
Assuming you have npm and Node.js installed:
a) Clone the repo
b) Orient yourself into the my-app folder
c) Type 'npm start' - this should open a browser window with the game, ready to play.
